You can find more details on our [project page](https://liruiw.github.io/hpt). An alternative clean implementation of HPT in Hugging Face can also be found [here](https://github.com/liruiw/lerobot/tree/hpt_squash/lerobot/common/policies/hpt).


**TL;DR:** HPT aligns different embodiment to a shared latent space and investigates the scaling behaviors in policy learning. Put a scalable transformer in the middle of your policy and donâ€™t train from scratch!


If you find HPT useful in your research, please consider citing:
